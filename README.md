# PANDAS DJANGO DEMO

This is a simple demo project to show off the following:
* How to use Python's core libraries and Pandas to transform, filter, and sort data on Hospital Value Based Care from healthdata.gov
* How to incorporate Jupyter Notebook into the workflow to pull, examine, extract, trasnform, and load data in an accessible and controlled manner
* How to include the workflow in Python's Django framework, to facilitate future inclusion of data micro-applications within a larger web application framework
* To show off the initial failure of using the native JSON format from healthdata.gov


This is intended only for demonstration purposes only, but the setting and application configuration can allow for future development work via forking this git.
